You don't really need docs for this (and I dont think three even is any)

Theres an example snippet in the [premade file](./snippets.json)

All you need to know is
- You can name the file whatever you want, just update the [extension.toml](../extension.toml)
- To pass args into the snippet code just use `$<arg number>` or `${<arg number>:<fallback>}`
